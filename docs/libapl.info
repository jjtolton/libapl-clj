libAPL
******

libapl is a C library, kindly contributed to the GNU APL project by Dr.
Dirk Laurie, that gives C programs access to GNU APL.

Almost everything that a user can do interactively with GNU APL can also
be done programmatically with libapl.  You can )LOAD and )SAVE
workspaces, evaluate APL expression, create Variables, and even call APL
primitives directly with values originating from in your C code.

The main facilities provided by libapl are listed in the following.

Some functions come in two flavours: one whose argument is a
(0-terminated and UTF8-encoded) C-strings (that is, a const char *) and
one whose argument is a const unsigned int * to a 0-terminated array of
Unicodes.

‘apl_exec(const char * line_utf8)’
‘apl_exec_ucs(const unsigned int * line_ucs)’
     pass a line to the interpreter for immediate execution as APL code.
     For example,

     apl_exec("1 2 3 + 4 5 6")

     should return the APL vector 5 7 9, which can then be accessed with
     other libapl functions such as get_rank(), get_axis(), etc.

‘apl_command(const char * line_utf8)’
‘apl_command_ucs(const unsigned int * line_ucs)’
     pass an APL command to the command processor and return its output.
     For example,

     apl_command(")CLEAR")

     should clear the current workspace and return "CLEAR WS".

‘APL_value’
     APL_value is a convenience typedef for a pointer to an opaque
     structure Value, supported by over 30 functions allowing one to
     construct a new Value and to gain access to its rank, shape and
     ravel.  In this document, the terms "Value" and "APL value" are not
     interchangeable; they refer respectively to a structure and to a
     pointer.

‘APL_function’
     APL_function is a convenience typedef for a pointer to an opaque
     structure Function, which is a defined APL function or a built-in
     function of the interpreter.  This pointer provides direct access
     of the eval__XXX() functions that are impemented by the function.
     In this document, the terms "Function" and "APL function" are not
     interchangeable; they refer respectively to a structure and to a
     pointer.  Every function implements a (typically small) subset of
     eval__XXX() functions that differ by the arguments that the take.
     The XXX stands for the signature of the function, e.g.  eval__fun_B
     for a monadic function, eval__A_fun_B for a dyafic function, and so
     on.  The possible arguments (in that order are: A (left value), L
     (left function of a dyadic operator), R (right function of an
     operator), X (axis argument of a function or operator), and B
     (right value).

‘eval__fun(APL_function fun)’
‘eval__A_fun_B(APL_function fun, APL_value B)’
‘eval__A_fun_B(APL_value A, APL_function fun, APL_value B)’
‘eval__A_L_oper_B(APL_value A, APL_function L, APL_function fun, APL_value B)’
‘eval__A_fun_X_B(APL_value A, APL_function fun, APL_value X, APL_value B)’
‘eval__A_L_oper_R_B(APL_value A, APL_function L, APL_function fun, APL_function R, APL_value B)’
‘eval__A_L_oper_R_X_B(APL_value A, APL_function L, APL_function fun, APL_function R, APL_value X, APL_value B)’
‘eval__fun_B(APL_function fun, APL_value B)’
‘eval__fun_B(APL_function fun, APL_value B)’
‘eval__L_oper_B(APL_function L, APL_function fun, APL_value B)’
‘eval__fun_X_B(APL_function fun, APL_value X, APL_value B)’
‘eval__L_oper_R_B(APL_value A, APL_function L, APL_function fun, APL_function R, APL_value B)’
‘eval__L_oper_R_X_B(APL_function L, APL_function fun, APL_function R, APL_value X, APL_value B)’
     These are the possible eval functions.  The APL_value returned by
     an eval__XXX() function shall be released with release_value() by
     the caller.

‘get_var_value(const char * var_name_utf8, const char * loc)’
     return an APL value pointing to the contents of a variable in the
     current workspace.

‘set_var_value(const char * var_name_utf8, const APL_value new_value, const char * loc)’
     set the contents of a variable in the workspace to that of the
     given APL value.

‘expand_LF_to_CRLF’
     this function controls whether linefeed (LF) characters shall be
     expanded to CR/LF on output.  The default is no expansion.  Please
     note that LF expansion may be triggered in other places, therefore
     expand_LF_to_CRLF(0) alone does not guarantee that no CR characters
     are being printed.

No other GNU APL header is exposed.

This document will not tell you much about APL. For more details about
the language, consult an APL reference manual such as those recommended
in the file ‘README-7-more-info’, which are probably installed in
‘/usr/share/doc/apl’ or ‘/usr/local/share/doc/apl’.

1 Vague details of the GNU APL implementation
*********************************************

Although the implementation is hidden from the API, the programmer needs
to know a little about it.

Only one workspace, simply known as "the workspace", is active at any
time.  The workspace may be cleared, named, saved and restored by calls
to ‘apl_command’.

The workspace contains a collection of symbols of various kinds.  Apart
from ‘apl_exec’ and ‘apl_command’, which behave as if entered from the
keyboard in an interactive APL session, this API gives access only to
APL variables, i.e.  symbols associated with Values.

A Value is a multidimensional array of cells.  It has three visible
components: rank, shape and ravel.

The shape is a vector of integers, giving the number of elements along
each axis of the array.  The number of shape items is known as the rank.
There is an upper bound to the rank, configurable when GNU APL is built,
which is displayed as a message by ‘apl_exec("⎕SYL[7;]")’.

The ravel is a vector of cells, accessed in APL by a multi-index but in
the API by a single index starting at 0.  As one progresses along the
ravel, the multi-index is ordered lexicographically, e.g.  in a clear
workspace, the multi-index of an array of shape ‘2 3’ would successively
be ‘1 1’, ‘1 2’, ‘1 3’, ‘2 1’, ‘2 2’, ‘2 3’.  The index origin in APL
may be changed by ‘apl_exec("⎕IO←0")’, but in the API the ravel is
always indexed from 0.

The number of elements in the ravel is given by the product of the shape
items.  An empty product is of course equal to 1, thus this calculation
is also valid for a scalar, which has rank 0.

A cell can hold any of several kinds of objects:

  1. A scalar, i.e.  either a number or a single 32-bit Unicode
     character.  The number may be stored internally as a 64-bit
     integer, a ‘double’, or a ‘complex<double>’.
  2. An APL value.  This allows nested arrays to be represented.
  3. None of the above, i.e.  information not accessible from the API.

The API does not give direct access to cell objects.  The user must know
what is in a particular cell and retrieve it by supplying its position
in the ravel, using a specialized access method for cells of that
particular type.  To this end, the cell type can be queried.  This is an
integer treated as a bit string.  The bits denoting cells accessible
from the API have predefined names.

CCT_CHAR    = 0x02
CCT_POINTER = 0x04
CCT_INT     = 0x10
CCT_FLOAT   = 0x20
CCT_COMPLEX = 0x40
CCT_NUMERIC = CCT_INT | CCT_FLOAT | CCT_COMPLEX

Attempting to retrieve the contents of a cell by the wrong access method
is an error that will crash the program.

* Lifespan of Values::


File: libapl.info,  Node: Lifespan of Values,  Up: Vague details of the GNU APL implementation

1.1 Lifespan of Values
======================

  1. All Values are invisible to the API. Internally, they contain a
     reference count, and are scheduled for destruction when the
     reference count reaches zero.  The actual destruction might not
     happen immediately.  The fact that one succeeded in accessing a
     Value does not prove that it is still alive, it merely means that
     it has not yet been destructed.

  2. All API functions that return an APL value increment the reference
     count.  It is your responsibility to decrement the reference count
     using ‘release_value’ when the Value is no longer needed.  Failure
     to do so will cause memory leaks.

  3. The APL value provided in the argument list of ‘res_callback’ (see
     *note Interface to APL interpreter: #interface-to-apl-interpreter.)
     has a particularly brief lifespan.  The execution of that function
     is your only chance of accessing it.  Its reference count is not
     increased before the call, so you must not release it.

  4. The type-specific ‘set_’ functions change one element only.  Other
     references to the Value concerned will also reflect the change; for
     example, if the APL value was returned by ‘get_var_value’, a
     following call to ‘get_var_value’ with the same variable name will
     show the change.

  5. ‘set_value’ and ‘set_var_value’ make a new deep copy of a
     non-scalar Value.  The reference count of the original Value is not
     increased.  Cloning (which is deliberately discouraged in the API
     by not providing a copy constructor) can be simulated with the aid
     of either of these.  The details are left to the persevering user.

The other parameter values have the following types:

‘val’                The main APL value
‘pval’               A secondary APL value
‘cval’               A 32-bit Unicode
                     character
‘ival’               A 64-bit integer
‘xval’,‘yval’        A 64-bit double
‘sval’               A UTF-8 encoded ‘char*’
‘i’                  A 64-bit index
‘k’,‘n1’,‘n2’,‘n2’   A 32-bit index

2.1 Constructor functions
=========================

Each of these functions returns an APL value and has a name descriptive
of its argument list.

‘int_scalar(ival,loc)’, ‘double_scalar(xval,loc)’,
‘complex_scalar(xval,yval,loc)’ and ‘char_scalar(cval,loc)’ initialize
to a given C value.

‘char_vector(sval,loc)’ initializes from a UTF-8 encoded C string to an
array of rank 1 containing Unicode characters.

‘apl_scalar(loc)’, ‘apl_vector(n1)’, ‘apl_matrix(n1,n2)’ and
‘apl_cube(n1,n2,n3)’ initialize to arrays of rank 0,1,2,3;
‘apl_value(shape,loc)’ initializes to an array of arbitrary shape.  All
cells in these arrays are initialized to 0.


File: libapl.info,  Node: Read access to Values,  Next: Write access to cells,  Prev: Constructor functions,  Up: Summary of functions

2.2 Read access to Values
=========================

‘get_rank(val)’, ‘get_axis(val,k)’ and ‘get_element_count(val)’ give
information about the shape,

‘get_type(val,i)’ returns the cell type of a ravel element.  The
predefined names can be used in e.g.  a ‘switch’ statement on the cell
type.

‘is_char(val,i)’, ‘is_int(val,i)’, ‘is_double(val,i)’,
‘is_complex(val,i)’ and ‘is_value(val,i)’ are conveniently named
front-ends to ‘get_type’ that do not require the user to examine the
cell type.

‘is_string(val)’ tests whether the entire value is a simple character
vector.  If so, ‘print_value_to_string’ can be used to convert it to a
UTF-8 encoded C string.

‘get_char(val,i)’, ‘get_int(val,i)’, ‘get_real(val,i)’,
‘get_imag(val,i)’ and ‘get_value(val,i)’ retrieve the actual contents of
a cell of which the type is already known, if necessary by having called
‘get_type’ or one of its front-ends.  For example ‘get_real’ can be used
if ‘get_type(val,i) & (CCT_FLOAT | CCT_COMPLEX)’ is nonzero.


File: libapl.info,  Node: Write access to cells,  Next: Interface to APL interpreter,  Prev: Read access to Values,  Up: Summary of functions

2.3 Write access to cells
=========================

Cells can be accessed only via an APL value pointing to their containing
Value.

‘set_char(cval,val,i)’, ‘set_int(ival,val,i)’, ‘set_real(xval,val,i)’,
‘set_imag(yval,val,i)’ and ‘set_value(pval,val,i)’ replace the contents
of cell ‘i’ of ‘val’.

It is not possible to change the shape of an APL value.


File: libapl.info,  Node: Interface to APL interpreter,  Next: Destructor function,  Prev: Write access to cells,  Up: Summary of functions

2.4 Interface to APL interpreter
================================

‘set_var_value(name,val,loc)’ and ‘get_var_value(name,val,loc)’ save and
retrieve values to the workspace under specified names.

An external function pointer ‘res_callback’ is called just before
‘apl_exec’ exits.  To exploit it, assign a suitable user-written
function to it, e.g.

/* callback to print every value */
static int always_print(const APL_value apl,int committed) {
  return 1;
}

/* callback to save a copy in the workspace under the name "_" */
static int save_to_workspace(const APL_value apl,int committed) {
  set_var_value("_",apl,LOC);
  return !committed;
}

/* One-off declaration statement, must not be inside a function */
result_callback res_callback = always_print_it;
...
/* A later assignment statement may be anywhere */
res_callback = save_to_workspace;
...
res_callback = NULL;      /* disables callback feature */

Here ‘apl’ is the anonymous value to which the APL expression evaluates.
You are granted access to it just before its brief lifespan expires.
‘committed’ is a C boolean (only 0 is false) reporting whether that
value was stored to a variable.  Your return value is a C boolean
telling whether the value should be printed by the APL interpreter.

The value ‘*apl’ (which the API cannot see) will be scheduled for
destruction as soon as you exit ‘res_callback’.  Don’t release it
yourself.


File: libapl.info,  Node: Destructor function,  Next: Print support,  Prev: Interface to APL interpreter,  Up: Summary of functions

2.5 Destructor function
=======================

‘release_value(val,loc)’ decrements the reference count of ‘*val’ as
explained in *note Lifespan of Values: #lifespan-of-values./


File: libapl.info,  Node: Print support,  Prev: Destructor function,  Up: Summary of functions

2.6 Print support
=================

‘print_value(value,file)’, ‘print_value_to_string(value)’ filter an APL
value through the APL formatting routines.  Their behaviour depends on
several system variables, such as ‘⎕FC’, ‘⎕PP’, ‘⎕PW’.

‘UTF8_to_Unicode’, ‘Unicode_to_UTF8’ are provided because ‘get_char’ and
‘set_char’ work with 32-bit Unicode, whereas many other user interfaces
use UTF-8.

3 Programming notes
*******************

The typical application would start with:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <apl/libapl.h>

This interface can be called from C, but since GNU APL is a C++ package.
the C++ library must be explicitly loaded, e.g.  in Linux:

cc myprog.c -lapl -lstdc++ -o myprog

* The loc parameter and LOC macro::


File: libapl.info,  Node: The loc parameter and LOC macro,  Up: Programming notes

3.1 The ‘loc’ parameter and ‘LOC’ macro
=======================================

All the functions that return APL values, as well as ‘release_value’ and
‘set_var_value’, contain a parameter ‘const char* loc’.  This parameter
is used to keep track of changes to a Value and may be displayed by
certain debugging services.  You can put in anything you like, but most
convenient is ‘LOC’, a macro that expands to the file name and line
number.
